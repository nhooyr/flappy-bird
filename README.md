I wrote this demo game for a short presentation I gave at the [Kaslo,
BC](https://jvh.sd8.bc.ca/) highschool to freshmen and sophmores to demonstrate how HTML,
CSS and JS can be used to create simple web apps.

Rest assured that if I were to make a real game, I would use canvas and not HTML elements
to drive the game. This was written purely for educational purposes.

note: I have no love for HTML, CSS or JS. The HTML DOM just happens to be a technology
that dominates our industry and thus makes for a good software starter toolkit for
newcomers. And it's what they were already learning from their teacher.
